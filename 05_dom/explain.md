so here is the explanation of Document Object Model(DOM) | 


What Is a DOM?
Think of a web page as a document. When a browser loads this document, it creates a DOM tree. Every element, attribute, and piece of text in the HTML becomes a node in the tree. The DOM provides an organized, hierarchical view of the document's content.



The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs like JavaScript can manipulate it. The DOM is not part of the HTML or CSS code itself; rather, it is a structured, tree-like representation of the document that allows a script to access and change the content, structure, and style of a web page.


The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree of objects (nodes), so that programming languages like JavaScript can interact with and manipulate the content, structure, and styles of the page.

Think of DOM as a bridge between web pages (HTML/CSS) and programming (JavaScript).
